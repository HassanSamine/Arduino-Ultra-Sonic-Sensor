# Arduino-Ultra-Sonic-Sensor

# Overview
This project demonstrates the use of an ultrasonic sensor with Arduino to measure distances and detect obstacles in real-time. The ultrasonic sensor emits high-frequency sound waves and measures the time it takes for the waves to bounce back after hitting an object. Based on this time measurement, the Arduino calculates the distance to the object and performs predefined actions.

# Components
The following components are used in this project:

Arduino Uno or compatible board

HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor

Jumper wires

Breadboard justPi

# Installation
To set up the project:

Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino board following the wiring diagram provided in the document "Arduino Ultrasonic Sensor".
Upload the Arduino sketch (LCD_ultrasonic.ino) to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE or any compatible IDE.
Ensure that the serial monitor is open to view the distance measurements and any detected obstacles.

# Usage
Once the project is set up and the Arduino sketch is uploaded:

Power on the Arduino board.
The ultrasonic sensor will start emitting sound waves and measuring distances.
View the distance measurements and any detected obstacles in the serial monitor.
Adjust the code as needed to perform specific actions based on distance thresholds or obstacle detection.
